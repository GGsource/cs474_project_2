## Folder Structure Explanation:

> lib folder - Contains the main ruby files to run the project.

> tests folder - Contains all the various files I used to test the project

> utils folder - Contains assignment PDF & file where I was testing binary numbers

## How to run project:

1. use `ruby .\lib\main.rb` to run main file, or do `cd .\lib\` first then `ruby .\main.rb`.
2. pass a valid file name when prompted. The file may be located in the `tests` folder or it may simply be in the `root directory`.
